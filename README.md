## Introduction

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has grown significantly in recent years. In a world awash with data, more and more
organizations are starting to recognize the benefits of using openly available information to better understand the
world.

Government agencies, investigative journalists, financial institutions, law enforcement, and other agencies are
increasingly making use of open information to gain business insights, expose wrongdoing, and tell compelling stories.
At QOMPLX our own OSINT Team works to gather and analyze open-source information to help our clients better understand
and reduce their own cybersecurity risk.



## Executive Summary

The State of OSINT contributors work in a diverse range of sectors, but almost all contributors noticed that OSINT had
become more important in their field of work. This growth in interest is reflected in increased demand for OSINT skills
and training. The past year has also seen growth in OSINT Capture The Flag exercises and online cooperation to solve
real-world missing personsâ€™ cases.

Technical skills are becoming more important for OSINT practitioners. Most of our contributors have emphasized the
increasing need for basic automation and programming skills in their OSINT work.

The growing interest in OSINT has also seen some negative trends too. OSINT techniques have been misused for
disinformation purposes, doxing, and harassment. Access to data is easier than ever before, but the discipline of
verification and analysis also has to be nurtured.
