What was your OSINT highlight of 2020? 2020 highlights: Personally, taking first place in the DefCon/Trace Labs SearchParty CTF was amazing. The Password Inspection Agency ( PIA) had taken second the month before so tackling the Balck Badge was rewarding.
Professionally, adding two new amazing OSINT specialists to the Intelligence team was substantial. Our team engaged in a number of OSINT assessments for 2020. Flexing the OSINT muscles professionally was a lot of work but extremely enjoyable.</description>

What was your OSINT highlight of 2020? I think the way that OSINT continued to become more mainstream in 2020. For years it has been a very niche interest but more people and organizations across a huge number of sectors are starting to recognize the value of being able to create and use open-source intelligence.
What emerging (good or bad) trends did you notice over the past year?</description>
