What was your OSINT highlight of 2020? My highlight of 2020 was getting to broaden my skillset outside of crypto, especially with python work.

 What emerging (good or bad) trends did you notice over the past year? I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that OSINT is actually a skillset many people have and use daily. In my opinion, that&amp;rsquo;s a great thing and should be humbling for the space. I think many of us consider OSINT to be a small group of experts, but there are so many other people out there doing great open-source research who just don&amp;rsquo;t know about the community or identify with the label.</description>
