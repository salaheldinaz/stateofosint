What was your OSINT highlight of 2020? I think I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight the so-called &amp;ldquo;FBI Etsy t-shirt case&amp;rdquo;, where the FBI was able to identify a participant in the George Floyd protests based on her t-shirt. She was wearing a shirt that she bought on Etsy, where she had also left a review. This, in addition to image analysis of photos and videos, where they were also able to identify a tattoo, ultimately lead to the arrest of the protester.</description>
